<section class="about"><div class="flex flex--center"><div class="col-1"><p>My name is Sean Burt and I am a second year Software Engineering student at the University of Victoria. After one year studying mechanical engineering I realized my passion was with computers and software. I quickly switched to software engineering and have not looked back.</p></div><div class="col-1"><p>Though I am newer with coding and software, I find I am able to pick up things quickly and like to learn these things. I don't particularly like having nothing to do, and therefore can be found trying to look ahead or trying new things. Once I finish my bachelors I hope to work with either security software, data management, or artificial intelligence.</p></div></div></section>
